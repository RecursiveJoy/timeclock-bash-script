# timeclock-bash-script
## A not-useful-yet script that functions as a time clock.

**Purpose:**
1. gets the time in, lunch out, lunch in, time out from user
2. converts the times to minutes past midnight
3. calculates how many minutes were worked that day
4. prints total time worked that day in hours and minutes.

I pray that transferring the file across text editors and operating systems maintained the Linux-like line-endings.
